        <h2>Header 2</h2>
        <h3>Header 3</h3>
        
        <p>Hello this is a paragraph.</p>
        This is text not using the paragraph tag.
        So Even if I drop a line in my text editor the text will be next to the last line.
        <br>This line has been dropped a line from me using a break tag but as you can see it does not put space between the lines like the paragraph tag.
        <p>This line is using the paragraph tag again.</p>

        <strong>Bold</strong>
        <br><em>Italic</em>
        <br><b>This is also Bold</b>
        <br><i>This is also Italic</i>
        
        <p>The second bold and italic line are using different tags. The first two lines are considered the correct way to do bolding and italics because certain browsers mainly mobile browsers cannot render the bottom two correctly.</p>
        <p><u>Underlining this way is also not considered correct anymore.</u> To underline that way is faster but not recommended because it's for different text instead of underlined words for example a misspelling or Chinese pronouns.</p>
        <p>If you wish to do underlining now it is recommended you use css instead.</p>
        
        <a href=Reference.html>text</a>
        <br>This is hyperlinked text the reason it takes you back to the same page is because it is linking to reference.html

        <ul>
            <li>Unordered list</li>
            <li>This orders text using the li tag but doesn't use numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Ordered List</li>
            <li>This is an ordered list this will put numbering for the included li tagged text.</li>
        </ol>
